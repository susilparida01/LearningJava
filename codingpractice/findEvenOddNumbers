/*
To define a number, find both even and odd numbers within a specified range, and output them in separate ArrayLists, you can use the following Java code:
*/
import java.util.ArrayList;

public class EvenOddNumberFinder {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Define the range
        int start = 1;  // Starting number in the range
        int end = 20;   // Ending number in the range

        // Create ArrayLists to store the even and odd numbers
        ArrayList<Integer> evenNumbers = new ArrayList<>();
        ArrayList<Integer> oddNumbers = new ArrayList<>();

        // Iterate through the range and find even and odd numbers
        for (int i = start; i <= end; i++) {
            if (i % 2 == 0) {
                evenNumbers.add(i);  // Add even number to the evenNumbers list
            } else {
                oddNumbers.add(i);   // Add odd number to the oddNumbers list
            }
        }

        // Output the ArrayLists of even and odd numbers
        System.out.println("Even numbers in the range from " + start + " to " + end + ": " + evenNumbers);
        System.out.println("Odd numbers in the range from " + start + " to " + end + ": " + oddNumbers);
    }
}

/*
Explanation:
1. Range Definition: The start (start = 1) and end (end = 20) of the range are defined.
2. ArrayLists: Two ArrayList<Integer> objects are created: one to store even numbers (evenNumbers) and one to store odd numbers (oddNumbers).
3. Loop: The loop runs through the range, and each number is checked:
4. If the number is divisible by 2 (i % 2 == 0), it is added to the evenNumbers list.
5. If the number is not divisible by 2 (i % 2 != 0), it is added to the oddNumbers list.
6. Output: The even and odd numbers are printed separately.
